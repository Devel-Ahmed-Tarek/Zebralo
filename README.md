# Zebralo Platform for Transport Brokerage

**[Demo](#)** | **[GitHub](#)**

## Project Overview

**Zebralo Platform for Transport Brokerage** is a full-stack platform developed to act as an intermediary between clients and transport companies. The platform allows clients to request transport services, receive quotes, and handle inspections directly through the platform without needing direct contact with the transport companies. This streamlines the process, making it easier and more efficient for both clients and transport service providers.

Built with **Laravel 10** and **Blade**, this platform enables smooth communication, quote management, and an intuitive user interface for managing transport requests.

## Key Features

- **Transport Request System**: Clients can request transport services, specify their needs, and receive quotes without contacting the transport companies directly.
- **Quote Management**: The platform automatically generates transport quotes based on the client's request and communicates them to the respective transport companies.
- **Inspection Management**: Inspections of transport services are managed through the platform, simplifying the process for clients and providers.
- **Admin Dashboard**: An admin interface to manage all client requests, transport companies, quotes, and inspections.
- **CRUD Operations**: Easy management of transport services, clients, requests, and company details via simple CRUD functionality.
- **Authentication**: Secure login and registration for clients, transport companies, and admin users.
- **Responsive Design**: Built using **Blade** for responsive and dynamic front-end views.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - **Laravel 10**: The PHP framework used to build the backend logic, including managing transport requests, quotes, and inspections.
  - **Blade**: Laravel’s templating engine used for rendering dynamic views in the frontend.
  - **Database**: **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL** for managing transport request data, quotes, and client details.
  - **Authentication**: Laravel’s built-in authentication system to manage client, transport company, and admin user logins.
